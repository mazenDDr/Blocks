# Project Void: Visual AI Workbench

Phase 0 (semantic and execution foundation), Phase 1 (visual CNN workbench: control API + editor), Milestone 2a (tabular graph kind:
data preparation, classical ML, statistics) and Milestone 2b (connected data sources, versioned extraction, studies and sweeps) are implemented.
See `docs/PLAN.md`, `docs/CAPABILITIES.md` and `docs/adr/` (ADR 0003: tabular graph kind; ADR 0004: connectors, snapshots, studies).

## Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r python/requirements.txt
.venv/bin/pip install -e .
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m connectors.install_pgserver      # local PostgreSQL for tests/example; pgserver has no CPython 3.13 wheel (see ADR 0004); `pip install pgserver==0.1.4` suffices on <= 3.12
pnpm -C apps/editor install
```

## Run the app (two terminals)

```bash
# 1. fixture + backend (http://127.0.0.1:8000)
source .venv/bin/activate
python examples/make_shapes10.py            # writes 200 PNGs to examples/data/shapes10 (gitignored)
python examples/make_tabular_fixtures.py    # rewrites the committed SYNTHETIC CSVs in examples/fixtures/ (deterministic; byte-identical)
python -m uvicorn control.app:create_app --factory --app-dir services --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000

# 2. editor (http://127.0.0.1:5173, proxies /api to the backend)
pnpm -C apps/editor dev
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:5173. The reference CNN loads as an unsaved draft. Use **Open** to switch project and graph kind: the examples
`tabular_regression`, `gamma_teaching` and `two_group_comparison` are tabular / statistics graphs (their data is synthetic or a teaching fixture and is
labelled as such); **New tabular graph** starts an empty one. For a tabular graph press **Run graph** in the bottom panel, then click nodes or wires:
table preview, profile, fitted state, coefficients, metrics, and the statistics view (density, shaded tail, observed statistic, p-value, alpha, decision).
For the reference CNN, click a node to edit it (change
`out_channels` and watch shapes and parameter counts propagate; lock `in_channels` to see a mismatch error), press
Run in the bottom panel (dataset folder `examples/data/shapes10` is relative to the backend's working directory),
then use the Weights / Activations tabs, click a wire, and compare runs. State lives in `.workbench/`
(`VOID_WORKBENCH` overrides it).

Production build and type check of the editor:

```bash
pnpm -C apps/editor build
pnpm -C apps/editor exec tsc --noEmit
```

## Connected data (Milestone 2b)

Open the **Data** tab in the editor to add connections (PostgreSQL, S3 or S3-compatible, DVC repository), test them and browse what they expose. Secrets are **references**
(an environment variable name, or a key in a JSON file outside the project); the value is never stored, returned or exported. Add a table, object or dataset as a source node
in a tabular graph; the PostgreSQL node has a visual query builder with the compiled parameterized SQL shown read-only (and a raw read-only SQL mode). Every run records a
snapshot of what each source returned (Source & snapshot tab); pin it to repeat from that identity. The **Experiments** tab plans and runs bounded grid/random sweeps with seeds and
folds as separate repeat dimensions, shows failed/retried/repeated trials, and compares a trial with the baseline.

The example runs on LOCAL TEST SERVICES with SYNTHETIC data (real PostgreSQL 16 via pgserver; an S3 API mock via moto, not AWS):

```bash
python examples/connected_journey.py --workbench .workbench           # seeds, saves project 'connected_journey', runs the regression and a small sweep, prints the results
python examples/connected_journey.py --workbench .workbench --serve   # ... and keeps the services + control API (127.0.0.1:8000) up; then `pnpm -C apps/editor dev` and open the project
```

## Tabular and statistics graphs from the command line

```bash
# validate + run the Gamma teaching example through the same worker path the API uses (prints the recorded p-value)
python - <<'PY'
import sys; sys.path[:0] = ["python"]
from graph_core.project_io import load_project
from tabular.engine import run_graph
from graph_core.validate import require_executable
g = load_project("examples/gamma_teaching.project.json").graph
out = run_graph(g, require_executable(g))
print(out["upper_tail"].summary["pValue"], out["test"].summary["decisionText"])
PY
```

Runs submitted through the API (`POST /api/runs` with a tabular graph and `{"config": {}}`) store events and artifacts in `.workbench/` like CNN runs.

## Research-level composition (Milestone 3)

Commands that were run for this milestone:

```bash
python examples/make_m3_examples.py        # writes the six Milestone 3 example projects (deterministic)
pytest -q                                  # unit, API and worker tests (the code-block tests start real sandbox subprocesses)
pnpm -C apps/editor build && pnpm -C apps/editor exec tsc --noEmit
```

In the editor, Open the examples `residual_cnn` (module instances, Expand / Open), `shared_encoder` (shared parameters), `masked_loss` (visual loss module as the training loss), `transformer_sequence`
(Training, Debug and Attention tabs), `code_block_demo` (Modules & code, Edit code) and `control_flow` (repeat and select). Training runs use SYNTHETIC data (labelled everywhere). See `docs/adr/0005`-`0007`.

## Run the tests

```bash
pytest -q
```

## JSON Schema export

```bash
python -m graph_core.export_schema          # writes packages/graph-schema/schema.json
```

## Train from the command line (Phase 0 CLI)

```bash
python -m worker.cli examples/reference_cnn.project.json --data examples/data/shapes10 --epochs 1
```

Prints one JSON event per line (run id, graph hash, seq, ts, type, node id, data) and a final status line.
Runs, events and checkpoints are stored in `.workbench/` (`meta.db`, `artifacts/<sha256>`). `Ctrl-C` requests a
cooperative cancel and leaves a `partial` checkpoint. A graph with an unknown op or a channel mismatch is
rejected before any training, with exit code 2 and the diagnostics on stderr.
